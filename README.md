# Madingley code for analyzing food web networks

This code was done while I was working during my internship at Microsoft Research Cambridge during the Spring 2014. This is personal code and therefore is not carefully commented.

The main use of this code is for loading, extracting, visualizing and analyzing the food web data generated by the Madingley simulation model. More information about this model is accesible from:
